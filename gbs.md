# Gelato Beach Skip (GBS)

GBS is the largest skip in the game, and saves between 10-12 minutes for any%. This trick is essential for any new runner to learn, and is simply too significant to put aside for another time. If you are going to run this game, you need to learn GBS.

Learning GBS can be a bit of a struggle, as there are a lot of nuances to the trick that are easily overlooked. As a matter of fact, whenever new runners ask for help with this trick, it is rare that they are dealing with some general skill issue. Rather, they tend to completely missunderstand the steps required to succesfully execute GBS in the first place. If done well, GBS can pretty much be executed with a 100% successrate, and this page will detail exactly how that is done.

The point of GBS is to collect the shine for episode 8 early, so technically this belongs to Gelato 8. However, it makes more sense structurally to leave GBS seperate, as it has nothing to do with actually playing episode 8 and is complicated enough that it needs its own section.
