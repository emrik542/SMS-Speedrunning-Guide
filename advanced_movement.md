# Advanced Movement
This page will cover advanced movement, and assumes knowledge from the page about basic movement.

## Hover Slide

A hover slide is performed by diving out of a brief hover, landing in the water excerted and entering a slide. This method provides greater acceleration than a normal water slide. 

It is advisable to make a habit out of initially spraying water for a brief period of time before switching to the hover nozzle. This will ensure there is water in front of Mario to slide into, but more importantly that FLUDD is not asleep. 

Attempting a hover slide while FLUDD is asleep means more time needs to pass in order for water to start being excerted. This increases the risk of a dry slide (not entering a water slide).

## Glitchy Wallkick (GWK)

During a wallslide, when pressing Y and then A within 3 frames, Mario will perform a wallkick while entering Y-Cam. This has the effect of reversing the trajectory of the wallkick, allowing Mario to wallkick towards or over structures.

### Glitchy Wallkick Dive (GWKD)

By pressing B one frame after doing a GWK, Mario will enter a dive during the GWK. This can be used to dive over and past walls and ledges.

### Glitchy Wallkick Hover (GWKH)

After doing a glitchy wallkick, Mario will be stuck in Y-Cam for half a second before being able to cancel out of it with a button press. By breifly hovering after the GWK, Mario will cancel out of Y-Cam instantly and be able to start moving again much faster.
