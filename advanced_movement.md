# Advanced Movement
This page will cover advanced movement, and assumes knowledge from the page about basic movement.

## Glitchy Wallkick (GWK)

{% include youtube.html id="rsREtzr0Wm8" %}

During a wallslide, when pressing Y and then A within 3 frames, Maio will perform a wallkick while entering Y-Cam. This has the effect of reversing the trajectory of the wallkick, allowing Mario to wallkick towards or over structures.

## Glitchy Wallkick Dive (GWKD)

{% include youtube.html id="EbE6EXztbBc" %}

By pressing B one frame after doing a GWK, Mario will enter a dive during the GWK. This can be used to dive over and past walls and ledges.

## Glitchy Wallkick Hover (GWKH)

{% include youtube.html id="jdMacd8xG8g" %}

After doing a glitchy wallkick, Mario will be stuck in Y-Cam for half a second before being able to cancel out of it and start moving again. By breifly hovering after the GWK, Mario will cancel out of Y-Cam instantly and be able to start moving again much faster.
