# Hover Slide

{% include youtube.html id="PrOPiB_3-LI" %}

A hover slide is performed by diving out of a brief hover, landing in the water excerted and entering a slide. This method provides greater acceleration than a normal water slide. 

It is advisable to make a habit out of initially spraying water for a brief period of time before switching to the hover nozzle. This will ensure there is water in front of Mario to slide into, but more importantly that FLUDD is not asleep. 

Attempting a hover slide while FLUDD is asleep means more time needs to pass in order for water to start being excerted. This increases the risk of a dry slide (not entering a water slide).

This movement is essential since it optimizes what is already the fastest form of movement in the game. You will be doing hover slides everywhere, all the time, in every category. Learn this, and make it a high priority.
