# Basic Movement
This page will cover the most basic movement for SMS.
## Moving Mario
Move Mario using the control stick. Tilting the stick at varying degrees provides full analogue controll of Marios walking speed. 

### Tiptoe
By tilting the control stick very lightly, Mario will move as slowly as possible, marked by his tiptoe animation. By bringing the control stick to its neutral position while tiptoeing, Mario will stop faster as opposed to going neutral from walking at full speed, since he will have to deaccelerate for a longer period of time.

# Jump
Press the A button to jump. The duration of the A-press regulates the jump height.

# Grab
Press B to grab. Certain objects such as fruits and barrels can be picked up by using this action.

## Air grab
Performing a grab whith no object in reach will casue Mario to freeze for 12 frames (0.4 seconds) which is called an air grab. 

# First person mode/Y-Cam
