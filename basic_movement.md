# Basic Movement
This page will cover the most basic movement for SMS.
## Moving Mario
Move Mario using the control stick. Tilting the stick at varying degrees provides full analogue controll of Marios walking speed. 

### Tiptoe
By tilting the control stick very lightly, Mario will move as slowly as possible, marked by his tiptoe animation. By bringing the control stick to its neutral position while tiptoeing, Mario will stop faster as opposed to going neutral from walking at full speed, since he will have to deaccelerate for a longer period of time.

## Moving Camera
Use the C-stick to move the camera.

### Center camera
Press L to center the camera behind Mario.

## Jump
Press the A button to jump. The duration of the A-press regulates the jump height.

### Double Jump
Jumping quickly after a previous jump will cause Mario to do a double jump, which provides more height. 

### Tripple Jump
Jump after a double jump while moving will cause Mario to perform a tripple jump, which provides even more height.

## Grab
Press B to grab. Certain objects such as fruits and barrels can be picked up by using this action.

## Air grab
Performing a grab whith no object in reach will cause Mario to freeze for 12 frames (0.4 seconds) which is called an air grab. 

## First person mode/Y-Cam
Press Y to enter first person mode, otherwise referred to as Y-Cam. Y-Cam can be cancelled by either hovering or pressing the Y, A or B button. Y-Cam can only be cancelled after 0.5 seconds with a button press, but can be cancelled instantly with hovering.
